      <p style="color:blue;">You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.</br> Darling😘, thanks for being always there for me. Every day I pray that our love would feed on goodness, because it will help us to live in peace and be always together, no matter the problems.</br>I will never forget the day we met. You were so beautiful babe (still are), and I knew right away that you would be the perfect partner in life. I'm lucky beyond words Malavi😘.</br>- Before I met you; I didn’t think love was for me. It was something other people had and felt. Something in movies and TV shows. It felt more like a wish I had than something real. Now that I’m with you, love is so much more tangible. It’s something I can reach out and touch. It’s so much more than a wish or a hope (though it does give me hope for so many things); it’s the genuine, wonderful person I wake up to—the warm hand next to mine, the brush of hair against my cheek. I love you malavi❤❤, and because of that love, I love so much more than you😘. I love myself and the world in a way I never thought possible. You’ve made that possible for me. You’ve made everything possible babe🥺🥺. Manna ya na mannna i am the most luckiest to have you to call you mine k🥺🥺...</br>As saying goes like this "Love is not something that you can express in words"(huna ta word le love ta express hunna). Love is something that is represented by actions and felt with the heart. I don’t know how much loved I make you feel but trust me, dear, you are the most precious thing,person in my life i mean everything..</br> <i>Jati timlai miss garxu ni aaile sama ma kasailai pani miss garya thiyena. I love you!😘</i></br>The way u look at me aww my heart boom i may not show ki but i feel shy ni but it's feels nice..</br>Ani ma kati keb rudely bolxu hola chitta ni dukhna sakxa hola..
